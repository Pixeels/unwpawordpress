      <h3 class="my-5 fs-4 py-5">A youth advocate is an adult who acts in the best interests of the youth that they are working with. The overall purpose of a youth advocate is to ensure that youth maintain their human rights while aiding in skill development in all areas of life such as education, health, housing, employment, relationships, etc. A youth advocate aims to prevent youth from experiencing diminished self-esteem while interacting 
          with adults who hold professional authoritative roles in their life. </h3>

      <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3 class="fs-4 my-5 py-5  mx-5 lh-base">Examples of these adults are judges, lawyers, teachers, etc. A speaker on the subject, describes a youth advocate as one who plays a significant supportive role in the social and legal processes in the lives of young people, especially homeless and foster youth who lack family support. In consideration of the legal aspects, the National Association of Youth Courts describes a youth advocate as a person who provides support to a youth respondent or defendant during a hearing.</h3>

          <h2 class="text-center fw-bold mb-4 fs-1">From the Declaration to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</h2>
          <p class="fs-4">Eglantyne Jebb knew that to have maximum impact Save the Children had to move beyond relief work. Her response was typically bold and visionary – to create a platform for the rights and welfare of children around the world. Her unique vision was a simple statement of rights that would have a claim on everybody dealing with children, not just the wealthy or the powerful. And so, although advocacy is sometimes presented as a new or recent activity, Save the Children was actually set up as an advocacy organisation.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">The Declaration of the Rights of the Child was adopted and promoted by the International Save the Children Union in 1923.Within a year it had been adopted by the League of Nations in Geneva.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-4">Some 65 years later, the Declaration became the basis of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). Adopted in 1989, the UNCRC is now the most important advocacy tool for children’s rights.</p>
